# hello-world
My first github repository

Hi humans!

My name is Christian Fitzgerald and before COVID-19 I was an Aircraft Structural Technician in Australian. I left a stable job about 1 month before COVID-19 became the pandemic we know today (whoops!) :/ and have had trouble rejoining the aviation industry due to COVIDs effect on air travel and the aviation industry in general.

During lockdown I had a bit of time to think about my career and found Information Technology required a lot of the same fundamental skills required to be a good aircraft tech. Skills such as problem solving, attention to detail and motivation to learn new things. 

I have started a Web Development course on Udemy and Iâ€™m currently learning the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I have been surprised at how easy it is to start learning and practicing skills like Web Development and I'm enjoying learning what you can make with these technologies. I'm excited to further explore what you can make with these incredible tools we call computers.

I've been looking up tools that will be useful to me as I continue my journey into the world of IT and heard this was an important one to get a grasp of. So here I am getting a hold of the basics.

Super excited to maybe one day be working with people on Github!

PEACE OUT!! ;)
